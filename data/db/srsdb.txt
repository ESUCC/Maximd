This instrument measured her academic skills in a wide \r\nrange of areas. Haley worked hard during the testing session and \r\nappeared to put forth her best effort on all items. She needed \r\nencouragement to attempt items that were difficult, but would attempt \r\nthem most of the time with verbal prompting. The following results \r\nshould be considered an accurate estimate of her current educational \r\nabilities as compared to her same age peers. <br />Haley's reading skills \r\nwere measured in 4 different categories, early reading skills, basic \r\nreading skills, reading comprehension and oral reading fluency. The \r\nearly reading skills measured Haley's knowledge of letter names, letter \r\nsounds, rhyming words, and beginning, middle and ending sounds. Haley \r\nrecognizes letters and letter sounds. She is also able to identify \r\nrhyming words and beginning sounds. She struggles to identify beginning \r\nblends and ending sounds in words. She was also able to blend segmented \r\nsounds together to make a word. She scored a standard score of 90. This \r\nis within the average range as compared to same age peers.<br />The word \r\nreading and pseudoword reading subtests are combined to get a standard \r\nscore for reading basic skills. Haley was able to read 2 letter words \r\nand cvc words. She struggled with words that contained blends and were \r\nmulti-syllable. She scored a standard score of 77. This is within the \r\nbelow average range as compared to same age peers. <br />The reading \r\ncomprehension subtest measures how well Haley is able to answer \r\nquestions over a passage that she has read independently. Haley \r\nstruggled to read the passages, but would go back and attempt to reread \r\nto find information after a question was asked of her. She struggled to \r\nanswer inference questions and was inconsistent on basic factual recall \r\nquestions. She scored a standard score of 77. This is within the below \r\naverage range as compared to same age peers.<br />The oral reading fluency\r\n subtest measures Haley's fluency, smoothness and pacing when reading. \r\nHaley was asked to read 2 different passages. One passage was narrative \r\ntext and the other was informational text. These grade level passages \r\nwere very difficult for Haley. She scored a standard score of 66. This \r\nis within the below average range as compared to same age peers.<br />On \r\nthe WIAT-III there is not a standard score for written expression until \r\n3rd grade, however 3 of the subtests that comprise written expression \r\nare administered. The first 2 subtests, sentence composition, measure \r\nhow well Haley is able to combine sentences together and formulate \r\nwritten sentences when given a specific word. Both of these tasks were \r\nextremely difficult for Haley. She was not able to accurately complete \r\nany of the items. She scored a standard score of 57 on the sentence \r\ncomposition subtests. This is below average as compared to her same age \r\npeers. The third subtest that is under the written expression umbrella \r\nis spelling.

style="font-family:Arial;"></span></b></sup><p><b>Educational\r\n Report: Haley was administered the Wechsler Individual Achievement Test\r\n third edition. This instrument measured her academic skills in a wide \r\nrange of areas. Haley worked hard during the testing session and \r\nappeared to put forth her best effort on all items. She needed \r\nencouragement to attempt items that were difficult, but would attempt \r\nthem most of the time with verbal prompting. The following results \r\nshould be considered an accurate estimate of her current educational \r\nabilities as compared to her same age peers. <br />Haley's reading skills \r\nwere measured in 4 different categories, early reading skills, basic \r\nreading skills, reading comprehension and oral reading fluency. The \r\nearly reading skills measured Haley's knowledge of letter names, letter \r\nsounds, rhyming words, and beginning, middle and ending sounds. Haley \r\nrecognizes letters and letter sounds. She is also able to identify \r\nrhyming words and beginning sounds. She struggles to identify beginning \r\nblends and ending sounds in words. She was also able to blend segmented \r\nsounds together to make a word. She scored a standard score of 90. This \r\nis within the average range as compared to same age peers.<br />The word \r\nreading and pseudoword reading subtests are combined to get a standard \r\nscore for reading basic skills. Haley was able to read 2 letter words \r\nand cvc words. She struggled with words that contained blends and were \r\nmulti-syllable. She scored a standard score of 77. This is within the \r\nbelow average range as compared to same age peers. <br />The reading \r\ncomprehension subtest measures how well Haley is able to answer \r\nquestions over a passage that she has read independently. Haley \r\nstruggled to read the passages, but would go back and attempt to reread \r\nto find information after a question was asked of her. She struggled to \r\nanswer inference questions and was inconsistent on basic factual recall \r\nquestions. She scored a standard score of 77. This is within the below \r\naverage range as compared to same age peers.<br />The oral reading fluency\r\n subtest measures Haley's fluency, smoothness and pacing when reading. \r\nHaley was asked to read 2 different passages. One passage was narrative \r\ntext and the other was informational text. These grade level passages \r\nwere very difficult for Haley. She scored a standard score of 66. This \r\nis within the below average range as compared to same age peers.<br />On \r\nthe WIAT-III there is not a standard score for written expression until \r\n3rd grade, however 3 of the subtests that comprise written expression \r\nare administered. The first 2 subtests, sentence composition, measure \r\nhow well Haley is able to combine sentences together and formulate \r\nwritten sentences when given a specific word. Both of these tasks were \r\nextremely difficult for Haley. She was not able to accurately complete \r\nany of the items. She scored a standard score of 57 on the sentence \r\ncomposition subtests. This is below average as compared to her same age \r\npeers. The third subtest that is under the written expression umbrella \r\nis spelling. This subtest looked at how well Haley was able spell words \r\nthat are dictated to her. Haley was able to spell 2 and 3 letter words, \r\nbut struggled with sounding out more complex words. She scored a \r\nstandard score of 72 on the spelling subtest. This is within the below \r\naverage range as compared to same age peers.<br />Haley's math skills were\r\n assessed utilizing the math calculations and math reasoning subtests. \r\nThe math calculations subtest is comprised of a variety of addition, \r\nsubtraction, multiplication and division problems. The problems increase\r\n in difficulty as she works through the problems. Haley was able to \r\nsolve basic addition facts trough the 5's. She utilized her fingers to \r\nhelp her solve the problems. She scored a standard score a standard \r\nscore of 65. This is within the below average range as compared to same \r\nage peers. The math reasoning subtest measured skills such as telling \r\ntime, counting money, interpreting a chart or graph, solving word \r\nproblems, and geometry skills. Haley was able to recognize numbers, but \r\nstruggled to order numbers and solve simple 1 step word problems. She \r\nscored a standard score of 50. This is within the below average range as\r\n compared to same age peers.<br />Overall, Haley demonstrates below \r\naverage academic skills. With encouragement she attempts tasks that are \r\ndifficult, but would benefit from small group and 1:1 support in all \r\nacademic areas. </b></p><b></b>";}}	\N	\N	t	\N
